Load in UCSC knownGene features
```{r}
txdb_grlist <- genFeatures(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene, featuretype = "all", reduce_ranges = FALSE, upstream = 1000, downstream = 0, verbose = TRUE)
```

Annotate if query features are present in knownGene
Create function to use in loop
```{r}
# Function to pull out the fraction of query records that overlap with a knownGene feature
get_feature_frac_overlaps <- function(query, features = txdb_grlist) {
  query_annotated <- query
  # Loop through types of features and annotate cis-hBTLs if they are present in that type of feature or not
  for (feature_names in names(features)) {
    query_annotated <- query_annotated %>% 
      plyranges::mutate("in_knownGene_{feature_names}" := overlapsAny(query, features[[feature_names]]))
  }
  
  query_annotated %>% 
    plyranges::summarize(transcript = sum(in_knownGene_transcript) / length(query_annotated),
                         promoter   = sum(in_knownGene_promoter)   / length(query_annotated),
                         intron     = sum(in_knownGene_intron)     / length(query_annotated),
                         exon       = sum(in_knownGene_exon)       / length(query_annotated),
                         cds        = sum(in_knownGene_cds)        / length(query_annotated),
                         fiveUTR    = sum(in_knownGene_fiveUTR)    / length(query_annotated),
                         threeUTR   = sum(in_knownGene_threeUTR)   / length(query_annotated),
                         intergenic = sum(in_knownGene_intergenic) / length(query_annotated)) %>%
    as_tibble() %>%

    as.data.frame() %>%
    rownames_to_column() %>%
    `colnames<-`(c("feature", "fraction_overlapping")) %>% 
    as_tibble()
}

Main loop
```{r}

    for (INDIVIDUAL in vector_individuals) {

      # Get baseline peaks overlap fraction with each feature
      peak_frac_overlaps <- 
        list_peak_wasp[[MODALITY]][[INDIVIDUAL]] %>% 
        get_feature_frac_overlaps() %>% 
        mutate(enrichment_type = "peak",
               .before = feature)
      
      # Get cis-hBTLs overlap fraction with each feature
      cis_hBTL_frac_overlaps <- 
        consensus.all.spaas.rpkm.bed %>% 
        plyranges::filter(mark == MARK, celltype == CELLTYPE, get(INDIVIDUAL) == TRUE) %>% 
        get_feature_frac_overlaps() %>% 
        mutate(enrichment_type = "cis_hBTL",
               .before = feature)
      
      # Join
      joined_overlaps <- 
        bind_rows(peak_frac_overlaps,
                  cis_hBTL_frac_overlaps) %>% 
        mutate(mark = MARK,
               celltype = CELLTYPE,
               individual = INDIVIDUAL,
               .before = feature)
      
      all_overlaps <-
        bind_rows(all_overlaps, joined_overlaps)
      
    }
  }
}
```

Simplify data by getting the average across all individuals for each modality
```{r}
all_overlaps_grouped <- all_overlaps %>% 
  group_by(enrichment_type, mark, celltype, feature) %>% 
  summarize(fraction_overlapping_mean = mean(fraction_overlapping)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # Create ordered factors for custom ordering of variables in panels of ggplot below
  mutate(enrichment_type = enrichment_type %>% factor(c("peak", "cis_hBTL")),
         mark = mark %>% factor(c("H3K4me3", "H3K27ac", "H3K4me1", "H3K9me3", "H3K27me3", "H3K36me3")),
         celltype = celltype %>% factor(c("BC", "LP", "LC", "SC")),
         feature = feature %>% factor(c("transcript", "promoter", "intron", "exon", "cds", "fiveUTR", "threeUTR", "intergenic")))
```


Visualize output
```{r}
# This chart displays the mean fraction of peaks and cis-hBTLs that overlap genomic features

all_overlaps_grouped %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = enrichment_type, y = fraction_overlapping_mean, fill = feature)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(vars(mark), vars(celltype)) +
  theme_bw() +

       y = element_blank())
