Code plan:
1. Load up top_hits_ranges (these are your search areas)
2. Load in corresponding WASP ChIP BAM for that modality
3. Count alleles in each peak


ASE analysis
Start with positive cis-hBTLs
Start with one modality (H3K4me3, BC)
Left join subsetted list with corresponding REF/ALT allele counts from all 8 samples
Create new row with ref/alt ratio for cis-hBTLs vs all sites and graph as side-by-side violin plots
